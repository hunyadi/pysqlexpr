# pysqlexpr: Expressive SQL for Python

`pysqlexpr` offers a robust yet flexible way to build SQL expressions and queries in Python, which helps write SQL code generators. Combined with a type checker such as `mypy`, `pysqlexpr` can validate expressions (e.g. composite logical expressions) and catch potential errors early in the development phase.

This package focuses on the Snowflake dialect of SQL.
